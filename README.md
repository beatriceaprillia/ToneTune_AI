### ToneTune AI Project

**Overview:**
ToneTune AI is an innovative project that leverages AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create personalized music playlists based on users' emotions and spoken commands. This project aims to enhance the music listening experience by providing emotionally resonant playlists through a user-friendly, hands-free interface.

## Libraries Used:
- **SpeechRecognition:** Converts speech input to text.
- **Flask:** Web framework to build the web application.
- **Logging:** Tracks application behavior and issues.
- **JavaScript SpeechSynthesis:** Provides verbal feedback to users.

## Benefits:
- Personalized music recommendations.
- Hands-free interaction with the playlist generator.
- Emotionally engaging music discovery experience.

## Features:
- **Speech Recognition:** Understands and processes user commands.
- **Emotion Detection:** Identifies user's mood to tailor playlist suggestions.
- **Playlist Generation:** Customizes playlists based on mood and genre.
- **Web Interface:** Simple and intuitive user experience with Flask.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Provides verbal confirmation and feedback.

## How It Works:
1. **Speech Input:** Users speak their music preferences or emotional state.
2. **Text Analysis:** The system extracts keywords indicating mood and genre.
3. **Playlist Selection:** Based on detected emotions and genres, appropriate Spotify playlists are suggested.
4. **Web Application:** Users interact with the system via a web app built with Flask, where they can trigger speech input and view playlists.
